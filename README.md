## <img src="./images/agreement.png" alt="agreement" width="20px" /> [`Smart Contract`](apps/crypto-lottery-contract)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd apps/crypto-lottery-contract
yarn install or npm install
```

### Run locally with [`Ganache`](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)

First start up ganache, by downloading it and running it on your computer or by installing the ganache-cli and running the following command

```bash
yarn ganache:start
```

After starting ganache, you will have a local blockchain running on your pc.

Run this command to deploy the contract migrations on the local blockchain (_**All migrations are written in `Typescript` and must end in .ts**_)

```bash
cd apps/crypto-lottery-contract
yarn truffle:migrate
```

Connect your metamask to the local network, by clicking on add network

```bash
Network Name = Localhost
New RPC URL = http://127.0.0.1:8545
Chain ID = 1337
Currency Symbol = ETH
```

Add a ganache account to access some funds

```bash
Copy a private key from a ganache account and click on MetaMask import account
```


### Deploy the smart contract in [`Thirdweb`](https://thirdweb.com/):

```bash
cd apps/crypto-lottery-contract
npx thirdweb@latest release
```

1. Open the thirdweb link and check the Mumbai(MATIC) Testnet to release the contract.

2. Use these Polygon Faucets to obtain some money for the polygon testnet gas fees:

    - [`Polygon Faucets`](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)
    - [`Polygon Faucets`](https://mumbaifaucet.com)
    - [`Polygon Faucets`](https://stakely.io/en/faucet/polygon-matic)

3. After releasing and getting some money, click on Deploy Now and select Mumbai(MATIC) Testnet.

4. Copy the deployed Contract's address (below the contract's name), create a .env.local file as the .env.example file and paste the value in this variable:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOTTERY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=
```

#

## <img src="./images/test.png" alt="agreement" width="20px" /> Solidity Tests

The tests are located in `apps/crypto-lottery-contract/test`

_**All tests are written in `Typescript` and must end in .test.ts**_

To run the tests execute the following command

```bash
yarn truffle:test
```
